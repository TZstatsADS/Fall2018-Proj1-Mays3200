### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. There are 8 figures. Figure 1 is the boxplot of the sentence length of each age groups. Figure 2 is the wordcloud. Figure 3.1-3.4 show the tf-idf analysis results of each age group. Figure 4 is about the LDA analysis result, in which we set the number of topics =2, thus there are two parts of this graph. Figure 5 shows the plot of the weight of topic1 and topic2 for each age group.
